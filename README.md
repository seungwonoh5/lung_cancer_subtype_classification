# Lung Cancer Subtype Classification using CNNs
Lung cancer is one of the deadly cancers in the U.S. Early Screening is crucial in cancer diagnosis but is error-prone to
false positives, which leads to unnecessary treatments and examinations. In this paper, we propose a method to classify lung cancer
subtype using deep learning models when input 2D joint histogram preprocessed from 3D CT scan images of patients.
With a simple Convolutional Neural Network architecture, we showed an improvement in correctly classifying both 1st
and 2nd dominant subtypes of lung cancer compared with a baseline method (which predicts with the average of training
labels).
